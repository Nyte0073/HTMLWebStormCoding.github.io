       Hello students and staff and welcome to my Software Engineering presentation! I am very excited
        to attend the University of Waterloo for Software Engineering or Computer Science,
        so today, I present to you a little bit about myself and my experience working several different tech
        related fields like FRC (First Robotics Competition), FTC (First Tech Challenge), and developing in my spare time.

        <br> <br> And with that, let's begin!
